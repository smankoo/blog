      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is a space for me to write.
A web log. A Blog in the original sense.
This is not meant for self-promotion, or to grab attention in any way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, there is an excellent chance that this text has an audience of one, me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Often I read or experience things - articles, books, movies, an interaction, a class - that evoke further thoughts or concepts in me.
This is a place to write those down. Mainly to get them out of my head, and possibly for the use of future-me. Writing them down also makes me try to structure them and really think through them. Without this process, I am truly convinced of my own beliefs, even if I can&amp;rsquo;t pin point exactly what they are.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
