I just saw a video of a child... a 6-7 year old boy, his limp dead body was being carried by a few people - one yelling at another to "put it in the car". His arms were mangled in unnatural positions, head torn open, and a piece of his open scalp hanging loosely. You could still see his beautiful Kashmiri face - now frozen forever. Broke my heart into a million pieces, and brought literal tears to my eyes.

The video claimed to be from Poonch, India. It might be, or it might be from Pakistan. I couldn't care less. What did that little boy ever do to either of them? Why did he deserve this fate? Why do his parents deserve to see him in that state?

How many more children need to die before we stop?
