This is a space for me to write.
A web log. A Blog in the original sense.
This is not meant for self-promotion, or to grab attention in any way.

In fact, there is an excellent chance that this text has an audience of one, me.

Often I read or experience things - articles, books, movies, an interaction, a class - that evoke further thoughts or concepts in me.
This is a place to write those down. Mainly to get them out of my head, and possibly for the use of future-me. Writing them down also makes me try to structure them and really think through them. Without this process, I am truly convinced of my own beliefs, even if I can't pin point exactly what they are. 

Not all the content here will be the intellectual kind. I may have book or movie reviews, or general musings in here too.

## Why not just write it in a journal?

Oh, I do that too. However, being publicly available means I need to dress up my thoughts as they are going in public, there's something to that. Whereas the thoughts in my journal stay at home and are usually in their pajamas - raw and beyond judgement.
