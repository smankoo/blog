I noticed it for the first time when I set up a plex server, which was on a repurposed old laptop. Then I graduated to rudimentary home automation (media centre, etc). Why? because I had got comfortable, and even used-to, the idea of servers at work. Messing around with the server at home further increased my proficiency and comfort level in \*nix systems, which I'm sure helped me at work. /home, df -h, ls -lrt, du -sh \*, ln -s, these commands became staple. As did apt-get and yum. I'm sure I got more proficient than my peers without realizing it. Their \*nix time was, after all, limited to the 9 to 5, whereas, that was also part of my leisure time.
