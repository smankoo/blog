Oversimplified phrases have often used to drive a sentiment - "Keep calm and carry on", "Hope and Change", "Ab ki baar, Modi sarkar". 

"Data is the out of the 21st century" is another one of those.

While I understand its function in driving home the importance of data, it is a fundamentally flawed statement that can lead to a misunderstanding and poor decision-making at the highest levels of an IT organization.

You either have it or you don't. That's not necessarily true with data. (true for facebook, google, not true for ABC Technologies.)
